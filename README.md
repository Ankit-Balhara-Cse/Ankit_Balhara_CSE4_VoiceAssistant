Discription: Lizza is a Python-based desktop voice assistant designed to simplify everyday tasks using natural voice commands. Built with PyQt5 for an intuitive graphical interface, Lizza listens for the wake word "Lizza" and then responds to user commands.
Once activated, Lizza can:
Open and close applications like WhatsApp, YouTube, ChatGPT, Notepad, etc.
Send WhatsApp messages to predefined contacts using voice input.
Search the web using Wikipedia and WolframAlpha.
Play music by searching YouTube Music.
Pause and resume music playback.
Display real-time mouse coordinates (for development/debugging).
The assistant uses libraries like speech_recognition, pyttsx3, pyautogui, and wikipedia, along with WolframAlpha's API for answering general queries. With a clean GUI and background threading, it provides a seamless voice interaction experience on Windows systems.
